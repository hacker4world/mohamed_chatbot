Kromberg & Schubert, as a global leader in manufacturing electrical systems, cable harnesses, plastic components, and wiring solutions for the automotive industry, faces numerous challenges in this sector. Below is a detailed analysis:
Supply Chain Challenges :
Impact of Geopolitical Events: The Russia-Ukraine conflict has disrupted the production of automotive wiring harnesses. Kromberg & Schubert and other major suppliers operating in western Ukraine have been forced to halt production, leading to vehicle production suspensions at some Volkswagen and Porsche plants. BMW has also been affected and is in talks with distributors to address the issue as soon as possible. According to Reuters, BMW stated, "Due to supply bottlenecks, interruptions to our production will occur. We are in intensive discussions with our suppliers." Additionally, Ukraine produced about 7% of the wiring harnesses imported into the European Union in 2020. Plants in cities like Stryi and Kolomyia not only manufacture wiring harnesses but also produce high-quality components for the automotive industry, employing approximately 60,000 people. The war has forced many automakers to freeze operations in Russia, with companies such as Volvo, Volkswagen, Ford, Honda, Toyota, and others halting vehicle and motorcycle exports to the country.



Ongoing Component Shortages: The global chip shortage remains unresolved, and the automotive industry continues to face supply chain issues. Limited inventory visibility and inaccurate procurement cost assessments strain financial stability. For example, AlixPartners estimates that in 2021, 7.7 million vehicles were taken out of production due to shortages, costing the industry $210 billion in lost revenue. Not only are electronic components in short supply, but magnesium and silicon, essential for manufacturing aluminum, are also scarce, leading to price increases.



Opaque Supply Chains: Many companies struggle with fragmented supply chain visibility. Inaccurate data increases risks such as theft, unauthorized sales, and counterfeit product substitutions. Limited insights into supply chain interactions hinder valuable collaboration with suppliers, resulting in missed opportunities and strained relationships. These inefficiencies ultimately threaten business performance and profitability.



Production and Operational Challenges :
Labor Shortages: The global automotive industry faces a labor shortage. In Eastern Europe, Kromberg & Schubert encounters competition for skilled workers. For instance, in 2023, the company announced plans to create 2,500 jobs at its Béja factory in Tunisia but faced recruitment difficulties. Rising labor costs in Germany have driven the company to expand to lower-cost regions like North Macedonia.
Rising Production Costs: Energy costs, including electricity and gas, are increasing, adding to production expenses. Logistics disruptions in maritime and road transportation further strain supply chains. For example, serious issues in maritime transport and significant price hikes have created market shortages and substantial cost overruns for brands. Road transport has also faced similar problems.
Complex Production Management: Kromberg & Schubert operates over 40 locations worldwide. The heterogeneity of platforms poses challenges for controlling and continuously optimizing production. Systems used at various locations need to be networked to enable full synchronization of machines and equipment with resource planning and manufacturing control systems. A key requirement is seamless data exchange between the control, management, and data integration levels to forward and concentrate production data and transfer recipes to controllers. The company uses controllers from Siemens and Beckhoff in conjunction with ERP and MES systems. To implement vertical data exchange, Kromberg & Schubert needed a standardized interface for all machines without adding extra PCs, such as for OPC server platforms.



Market and Competitive Challenges :
Market Transformation Pressure: The rise of electric vehicles (EVs) is pushing traditional combustion engine vehicles to adapt or phase out. Traditional automakers and suppliers face declining margins while needing to invest more in electromobility and customer-oriented innovations. Kromberg & Schubert must navigate supply issues and skilled labor shortages impacting production while managing the current economic and political landscape to maintain its competitive edge.
Intensified Market Competition: New competitors are entering the market, reshaping it through mergers and acquisitions.

For example, its Slovak branch leveraged dynamic simulation tools to design new production layouts, detect hidden bottlenecks in advance, and optimize production processes. However, achieving seamless data integration across global facilities remains a challenge.



Quality and Recall Challenges :
Quality Control Issues: Weak quality control and the use of substandard materials from suppliers can lead to product reliability problems. In the automotive industry, quality is a critical concern, with costly recalls becoming increasingly common. Tracing and tracking products back to suppliers remains a weak point in supplier quality management. Even minor quality variations may necessitate rework and error correction at client sites, incurring additional costs such as sorting, inspection, rework, and reshipment. These efforts are unavoidable to protect brand reputation and user safety.
Recall Burden: Automakers frequently face recalls due to issues like faulty airbags and brake fluid leaks. These recalls damage brand reputation and impose significant retrofitting expenses. For instance, AlixPartners estimates that in 2021, 7.7 million vehicles were taken out of production due to shortages, costing the industry $210 billion in lost revenue.



Talent and Workforce Challenges :
Workforce Transition: The automotive industry needs to replace retiring workers (over 25% of manufacturing workers are aged 55 or older) while retaining institutional knowledge for new employees. The incoming millennial workforce expects flexible benefits and a good work-life balance, requiring companies to adjust their workplace practices.
